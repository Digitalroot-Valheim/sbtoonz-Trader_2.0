This is a new trader you can find in Valheim. He is Haldors cousin...only by marriage though. 

You can find this trader randomly spawned in the meadows. Alternatively you can always spawn him using the prefab name
``Knarr``

### Configuration

There is a yaml file that is generated on first launch of the mod. This file will live in your BepInEx/configs folder and becalled trader_config.yaml

You are required to put the items you wish the trader to sell as well as their cost and stack in this YAML file 

Example as shown:
```yaml
PrefabName:
  cost: 100
  stack: 10

Acorns:
  cost: 1 
  stack: 1
```

where you see PrefabName you need to put the prefab the trader should sell. Yes this trader supports custom items.
